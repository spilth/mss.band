# Intro Chorus

[D7]Oh, it's [G]crying time again, you're gonna [D]leave me.
I can [D7]see that far away look, in your [G]eyes.
I can [G7]tell by the way you hold me, [C]darling.
That it [G]won't be long, be-[D]fore it's crying [G]time.

# Verse 1

Now, they [G]say that absence, makes the heart grow [D]fonder.
And that [D7]tears are only rain to make love [G]grow.
Well, my [G7]love for you could never grow, no [C]stronger.
If I [G]lived to be a [D]hundred years [G]old.
