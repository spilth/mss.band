<h2>How can I connect with others in the meetup?</h2>

<p>We use <a href="https://groupme.com/join_group/99850258/7CqilUbm">GroupMe</a> as our group chat to coordinate our meetups and talk about music.</p>

<p>You can also check <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mssband.bsky.social">our BlueSky account</a> for next event dates, cancellations, etc.</p>

<h2>When do you meet?</h2>

<p>We meet every other Wednesday evening around 6:00pm ET.</p>

<p>In the colder months we meet a little earlier and in the hotter months we meet a little later.</p>

<h2>What should I bring?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>An instrument, your singing voice or both!</li>
  <li>A chair to sit on (if you don't want to stand)</li>
  <li>A music stand (if you have one)</li>
  <li>A capo (if you have a stringed instrument)</li>
</ul>

<p>The host will provide several copies of the songbook for reference.</p>

<h2>Where do you meet?</h2>

<p>We meet in Coolidge Park in Chattanooga, TN. We play under the Market Street/John Ross Bridge.</p>

<p>The bridge protects us from light rain. But if there's heavy rain or thunderstorms in the forecast 2-3 hours before the meetup then we will likely cancel.</p>
